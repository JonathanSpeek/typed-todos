# Todos v1 âœ…

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/685b3de5-8f4d-412a-8aff-98c6b0f7e33d/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/typed-todos/deploys)

## Tech Stack

- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

## Goals

This is a mostly basic domain with which to experiment with different technologies. Instead of building something complex, I'm building the classic todo list with a smidge of complexity. This allows me to not just try one new technology, but multiple things all at once. in v1, I'm trying out TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and Cypress (first time on a personal project).

## What this isn't

This is not going to be perfect code. This is not going to be maintained.
